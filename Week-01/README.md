### 🐍 Day 3 – Python Programming Basics  
The core of Week 1 centered on Python – the language of AI 🐍💡.  
Topics included:  
- *What is a Program?* and **Code vs No-Code** approaches  
- **Python Syntax**, Operators, and Data Types  
- **Lists, Sets, Tuples, and Dictionaries** 📘  
- **Control Flow**, Loops, Functions, and Error Handling 🔁  
- **File Handling** – Reading, Writing, and Managing Files 🗂️  
Learners practiced running scripts in VS Code and Google Colab, and even experimented with **AI-assisted Python coding** 💻🤖.

### ⚙️ Day 4 – RPA with Python  
Automation took the spotlight with **RPA (Robotic Process Automation)** ⚡.  
Key modules and tools covered:  
- **PyAutoGUI** – Keyboard & Mouse automation 🖱️⌨️  
- **Playwright & Selenium** – Browser automation 🌐  
Hands-on demos showed how AI can control systems autonomously through scripts and events.  
An **RPA assignment** challenged students to build their own workflow – bridging the gap between logic and automation 🤖⚙️.

### 🌐 Day 5 – APIs & Web Frameworks  
The week advanced into web integration 🌍.  
We learned to:  
- Understand **REST APIs** and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) 🧩  
- Use **Postman** for testing endpoints 📬  
- Create a **Flask app** 🔥 and a simple **Streamlit web interface** 🖥️  
By Day 5, everyone had built their first web application powered by Python – a huge step toward AI product development 💼🚀.

---

### 🧾 Day 6 – Assignments & Assessments  
**Week 1 Assignment and Assessment** 🧠✅  
Learners compiled RPA and API projects, uploaded them to GitHub, and completed self-check quizzes and resources to evaluate progress.  
This day reinforced discipline and consistency – transforming knowledge into applied skill 📚💪.

### 💻 Day 7 – Jupyter Notebook & Online DCS Session  
The week culminated with hands-on practice in **Jupyter Notebook inside VS Code** 🧮💻 and the **Online DCS session (6 June 2025)**.  
Live sessions covered:  
- Consolidation of Python and RPA automation concepts  
- Demonstrations of scripts running in real time ⚙️  
- Peer sharing and mentor feedback to solidify learning 🤝  
This marked the official completion of Week 1 and the beginning of a structured AI learning journey 🎯.
