# 🪔 Post 4 — Lighting the Community Path
**GenAI Architect Program | Festival of Lights Series** 🌟  

The beauty of light is that it never keeps to itself — it spreads 🌠  
And in our **GenAI Architect community**, learning feels like one person lighting the way for another 🔥  

We didn’t just learn AI; we built a **community of light** — where generosity, curiosity, and laughter became our shared codebase 💬💛  

> “A lamp that lights another loses nothing — it only makes the night brighter.” 🌟  

### 💭 Reflection
The brightest lamps don’t stand alone — they stand together.  
In lighting the community path, I discovered something even greater than learning: **the joy of shared purpose.** 🌍🪔
