# ?? Post 3 — Clearing the Shadows
**GenAI Architect Program | Festival of Lights Series** ??  

Every journey has its light — and its shadows ????  
In the world of AI, those shadows come as errors, bugs, and confusing outputs that test our patience and persistence.  

But just like during the Festival of Lights, where we clean and brighten our homes before lighting the lamps, in learning AI we **clear the mental clutter** — the doubts, frustration, and fear of failing — to let understanding shine through ??  

There were times I spent hours fixing a broken n8n node, a missing bracket in code, or a fine-tuning loop that wouldn’t end. But each challenge was a shadow waiting for light — and every “Aha!” moment was a spark that burned brighter because of it ??  

> “Every bug you fix is a candle lit in the dark.” ??  

### ?? Reflection
True learning isn’t about avoiding the dark — it’s about *bringing your own light* when it gets hard to see.  
The shadows make the glow meaningful, and each struggle makes the success shine brighter ???
