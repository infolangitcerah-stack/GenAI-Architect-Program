# 🪔 Post 3 — Clearing the Shadows
**GenAI Architect Program | Festival of Lights Series** 🌟  

Every journey has its light — and its shadows 🌑💡  
In AI, those shadows come as errors, bugs, and confusing outputs that test our patience and persistence.  

But just like during the Festival of Lights, we first **clear the mental clutter** — doubts, frustration, and fear — to let understanding shine through 🌠  

> “Every bug you fix is a candle lit in the dark.” 💫  

### 💭 Reflection
True learning isn’t about avoiding the dark — it’s about *bringing your own light* when it gets hard to see.  
The shadows make the glow meaningful, and every struggle makes the success shine brighter 🪔✨
